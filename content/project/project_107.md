This project specifically will expand our package documentation containing tips and strategies on how to collect and analyze various forms of physiological data and the use of our packages. Contributors may get started from any skill set and level, as this project will predominantly be focused on documentation contributions. Most of all, we are looking for people excited to learn (and contribute to) the best practices in physiological signal acquisition.\n\n### Link to project repository/sources\n\nhttps://github.com/physiopy/physiopy.github.io \n\n### Goals for Brainhack Global\n\nWe aim to provide a succinct overview of what physiological data are typically recorded during an fMRI experiment, how these signals are recorded, and how these signals can improve our modeling of fMRI time series data. This is an active field of research, and we hope to encourage all users to get the latest recommendations prior to initiating a new study.\n\n### Good first issues\n\n1. Improve the documentation for Physiopy\u2019s packages\r\n2. Build best practices libraries and summaries for various physiological signals (e.g., respiratory, cardiac, skin conductance, etc.)\r\n3. Search for additional open source libraries and software similar to what we do\r\n4. Find links to educational courses of interest\r\n5. Enlarge our list of open source datasets with physiological signals\r\n6. Improve the website\u2019s interface\r\n\n\n### Communication channels\n\nhttps://physiopy.slack.com/archives/C042U2KLF36 \n\n### Skills\n\nGitHub: basic\r\nMarkdown: basic to advanced\r\nPhysiological data acquisition/analysis: basic to advanced\r\n\n\n### Onboarding documentation\n\nhttps://docs.github.com/en/get-started \r\nhttps://www.markdownguide.org/\r\n\n\n### What will participants learn?\n\nParticipants will learn (at least) the basics about different types of physiological data acquired in neuroimaging setups and how they can be used. In addition, they will get acquainted with Github and Markdown, which may be helpful in other contexts.\n\n### Data to use\n\n_No response_\n\n### Number of collaborators\n\nmore\n\n### Credit to collaborators\n\nProject contributors are listed on our Team page.\n\n### Image\n\n![Physiopy_logo_BHG](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/24605642/204376872-daf0f6ff-0d19-4a90-9825-d78e7169615a.png)\r\n\n\n### Type\n\ndocumentation\n\n### Development status\n\n1_basic structure\n\n### Topic\n\nMR_methodologies, physiology\n\n### Tools\n\nother\n\n### Programming language\n\ndocumentation\n\n### Modalities\n\nfMRI, MRI\n\n### Git skills\n\n0_no_git_skills, 1_commit_push, 2_branches_PRs\n\n### Anything else?\n\n_No response_\n\n### Things to do after the project is submitted and ready to review.\n\n- [ ] Add a comment below the main post of your issue saying: `Hi @brainhackorg/project-monitors my project is ready!`\n- [ ] Twitter-sized summary of your project pitch.",
