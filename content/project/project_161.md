Currently this is a cmdline driven process, which isn't always an accessible means for all labs.  Building a gui front end will allow for easier ability to generate open MEG data for collaboration.\r\n- To get started visit the git page.  This has links for PyQt overview and installation.\r\n\r\n\n\n### Link to project repository/sources\n\nhttps://github.com/jstout211/MEGBIDS_gui\n\n### Goals for Brainhack Global\n\nInitial prototype for Gui frontend.\r\n\r\nWorking example of meg / mri / transform to BIDS structure\n\n### Good first issues\n\n1. issue one:\r\n\r\n2. issue two:\r\n\n\n### Communication channels\n\nSlack - will update\n\n### Skills\n\n-Python : Some experience, but parts of the project will require minimal coding (QT Designer)\r\n-MNE/MNE_BIDS: Bonus\n\n### Onboarding documentation\n\n_No response_\n\n### What will participants learn?\n\nGUI design and interfacing with python functions\n\n### Data to use\n\nOpen access MEG/MRI from openneuro and mne sample datasets - find these on github page\n\n### Number of collaborators\n\n4\n\n### Credit to collaborators\n\nProject contributors iwll be listed on the github page readme\n\n### Image\n\nLeave this text if you don't have an image yet.\n\n### Type\n\ndata_management\n\n### Development status\n\n0_concept_no_content\n\n### Topic\n\nother\n\n### Tools\n\nMNE\n\n### Programming language\n\nPython\n\n### Modalities\n\nMEG\n\n### Git skills\n\n1_commit_push\n\n### Anything else?\n\n_No response_\n\n### Things to do after the project is submitted and ready to review.\n\n- [X] Add a comment below the main post of your issue saying: `Hi @brainhackorg/project-monitors my project is ready!`\n- [ ] Twitter-sized summary of your project pitch.",
