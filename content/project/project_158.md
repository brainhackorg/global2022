We will work on the materials for a one-day workshop course, Introduction to MATLAB, that have been previously developed and can be improved in documentation, topics covered, etc.  The goal of the Bootcamp itself is to make the startup process for programming accessible and to give the basics such that someone can feel comfortable beginning their journey with MATLAB or any programming language -- whether they plan to use it for neuroimaging analysis, modeling neuron membrane potentials, or anywhere in between.\n\n### Link to project repository/sources\n\nn/a\n\n### Goals for Brainhack Global\n\nGoals/options for project:\r\n- Work through MATLAB introduction and mini-exercises \r\n- Work through data exercises\r\n- Clean up previously-created livescript\r\n- Add more tips & tricks and mini-exercises to the livescript\r\n- Add more advanced skills / create advanced cheat sheet\r\n- Post to Github\n\n### Good first issues\n\n1. issue one: Add more exercises to practice livescript.\r\n\r\n2. issue two: Improve data exercises to assess more skills and have clearer documentation\r\n\n\n### Communication channels\n\nhttps://join.slack.com/t/brainhack-dc/shared_invite/zt-1jmk1c44g-kDy89JuklhWLMUVEJEnUuQ\n\n### Skills\n\nNo programming skills required to work through the Intro to MATLAB Bootcamp exercises; basic MATLAB knowledge needed to contribute to documentation / exercise materials\n\n### Onboarding documentation\n\n_No response_\n\n### What will participants learn?\n\nBasic MATLAB/programming skills, more advanced MATLABbing skills, educational material development, and collaboration!\n\n### Data to use\n\n_No response_\n\n### Number of collaborators\n\n1\n\n### Credit to collaborators\n\nWill be added to the documentation and if we post on Github, to the README file\n\n### Image\n\nLeave this text if you don't have an image yet. :)\n\n### Type\n\ncoding_methods, tutorial_recording\n\n### Development status\n\n1_basic structure\n\n### Topic\n\nreproducible_scientific_methods, statistical_modelling\n\n### Tools\n\nother\n\n### Programming language\n\nMatlab\n\n### Modalities\n\nnot_applicable\n\n### Git skills\n\n0_no_git_skills, 1_commit_push, 2_branches_PRs, 3_continuous_integration\n\n### Anything else?\n\n_No response_\n\n### Things to do after the project is submitted and ready to review.\n\n- [ ] Add a comment below the main post of your issue saying: `Hi @brainhackorg/project-monitors my project is ready!`\n- [ ] Twitter-sized summary of your project pitch.",
