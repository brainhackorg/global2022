Similarly, cognitive deficits due to trauma or neurological conditions, such as after stroke, crucially depend on network-level alterations that disrupt normal interactions among multiple brain areas. Although central, progress towards testing these hypotheses has been limited by the lack of approaches for studying interactions between multiple brain regions beyond pairwise relations, the so-called higher-order interactions (HOIs). The aim of our project is to build a novel approach based on recent advances in information theory (the O-information metric) to infer task- or condition-specific HOIs (functional HOIs) from brain signals. We will explore the possibility to combine O-information estimates with permutation-based statistics implemented in [Frites](https://github.com/brainets/frites)\r\n\r\n### Link to project repository/sources\r\n\r\n# Toolboxes\r\n\r\n- [HOI toolbox 2021](https://github.com/brainets/hoi_bhk)\r\n- [Frites](https://github.com/brainets/frites)\r\n\r\n# Papers\r\n\r\n-  [Rosas et al. 2019](https://journals.aps.org/pre/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevE.100.032305) \r\n- [Stramaglia et al. 2021](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fphys.2020.595736/full)\r\n\r\n### Goals for Brainhack Global\r\n\r\nThe main goal of this BrainHack is to have a working first version of the task-related HOI\r\n\r\n### Good first issues\r\n\r\n1.
