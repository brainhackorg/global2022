There has been a lot of work on generating new music from a large collection of music using deep AI models, as well as some work on generating music from brain EEG/fMRI signal through algorithmic or rule based approaches. However there has not been work done on using deep learning models to generate music from EEG/fMRI signal.\r\n\r\nIn this project, we will use deep generative models to allow EEG/fMRI data to be used as an input to generate music. More details of the design can be found on our Github page.\r\n\n\n### Link to project repository/sources\n\nhttps://github.com/marianocabezas/brainharmonic\n\n### Goals for Brainhack Global\n\nDevelop a tool to generate songs from EGG/fMRI brain signals using deep learning\n\n### Good first issues\n\nCurrently we have a pipeline to generate musical motif from a time series and a deep learning model to output a song from the generated motif. This was tested with a list of EEG signals from multiple subjects. We can build upon the existing work in three aspects\r\n1. Issue one:\r\nDevelop a pipeline to process time series signals (fMRI, EEG, etc) and feed the output to the music generation part\r\n2. Issue two\r\nRefine current DL to resolve some existing issues and produce better music  \r\n3. Issue three\r\nProcess signals from different brain regions as different instruments to create multitrack songs. \r\n\n\n### Communication channels\n\nhttps://mattermost.brainhack.org/brainhack/channels/brainharmonic\n\n### Skills\n\nPython: intermediate\r\nPytorch: beginner\r\nEEG/fMRI data processing: beginner\n\n### Onboarding documentation\n\nhttps://github.com/marianocabezas/brainharmonic\n\n### What will participants learn?\n\nEEG/fRMI data preprocessing\r\nDeep learning generative models\r\nExisting music-to-music deep AI frameworks\n\n### Data to use\n\n_No response_\n\n### Number of collaborators\n\n3\n\n### Credit to collaborators\n\nProject contributors are credited on Readme file on project Github page\n\n### Image\n\nLeave this text if you don't have an image yet.\r\n\n\n### Type\n\ncoding_methods, method_development, pipeline_development\n\n### Development status\n\n1_basic structure\n\n### Topic\n\ndeep_learning\n\n### Tools\n\nfMRIPrep, Freesurfer, Jupyter\n\n### Programming language\n\nJulia, Python\n\n### Modalities\n\nEEG, fMRI\n\n### Git skills\n\n1_commit_push\n\n### Anything else?\n\n_No response_\n\n### Things to do after the project is submitted and ready to review.\n\n- [X] Add a comment below the main post of your issue saying: `Hi @brainhackorg/project-monitors my project is ready!`\n- [X] Twitter-sized summary of your project pitch.",
