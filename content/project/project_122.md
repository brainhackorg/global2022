Often most, researchers looking for a way to set up online experiments will find themselves either using a) complex and tool-specific paradigms or b) to develop their own web code to suit their specific needs.\r\nFor this Brainhack project, we aim to develop a **fast** and **flexible** tool which would allow anyone to perform custom **psychophysical** investigations through the web. For their convenience, users will be generating their own stimuli locally, uploading them into a GitHub repo, and we will develop a tool which will allow reliable online procedures to be deployed using their stimuli.\r\n\r\n### Link to project repository/sources\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/JNJER/PsychophyGit\r\n\r\n### Goals for Brainhack Global\r\n\r\n* Develop Python code that allows to deploy psychophysical experiments with light requirements (python skills) \r\n* Develop a server-side interface which parses GitHub repos to get experimental stimuli (javascript skills)\r\n* Create simple 2 Alternative Forced Choice tasks (psychophysics skills)\r\n\r\n\r\n### Good first issues\r\n\r\n* Parsing git repos to get stimuli\r\n* Creating a web browser-based interface\r\n* Generate RGPD compliant data parsing\r\n\r\n\r\n### Communication channels\r\n\r\nhttps://framateam.org/int-marseille/channels/brainhack2022_psychophygit \r\n\r\n### Skills\r\n\r\n- Python coding : 70 %\r\n- Javascript coding : 50 %\r\n- Psychophysics : 30 % \r\n\r\n\r\n### Onboarding documentation\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### What will participants learn?\r\n\r\n- How to manage server-side Python code\r\n- How to interface Python script with Javascript GUI\r\n- Have a fun time on a fun project !\r\n\r\n\r\n### Data to use\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### Number of collaborators\r\n\r\n2\r\n\r\n### Credit to collaborators\r\n\r\nProject contributors are listed on the project README using the all-contributors github bot. \r\nIn case any scientific production would stem from the project, all project contributors would be adequately listed as authors.\r\n\r\n### Image\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/16063162/203026153-ee45563a-5ea0-4f43-833c-b2633e5bcbb1.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n### Type\r\n\r\nmethod_development\r\n\r\n### Development status\r\n\r\n0_concept_no_content\r\n\r\n### Topic\r\n\r\nsystems_neuroscience, other\r\n\r\n### Tools\r\n\r\nother\r\n\r\n### Programming language\r\n\r\nPython\r\n\r\n### Modalities\r\n\r\nbehavioral\r\n\r\n### Git skills\r\n\r\n1_commit_push\r\n\r\n### Anything else?\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### Things to do after the project is submitted and ready to review.\r\n\r\n- [X] Add a comment below the main post of your issue saying: `Hi @brainhackorg/project-monitors my project is ready!`\r\n- [X] Twitter-sized summary of your project pitch.",
