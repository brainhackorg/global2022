In poorly cued environments (e.g. in darkness) this can only be done by estimating the direction and the distance in order to compute a vectorial integration of the movement (so called path-integration). In a set of studies in rats we demonstrated that the entorhinal cortex plays a fundamental role in path integration. However, how the circuit infers the running distance is yet to be known. Using a distance estimation task, we discovered that the theta oscillations of the local field potential and the firing pattern of single neurons in the entorhinal cortex correlate with the running distance estimated by the rats. But how much and how well the unitary and the field activity allow the circuit to infer about the travelled distance?\r\nIn the context of the BrainHack Marseille 2022, we would like to interact and collaborate with people with a good knowledge of neural decoding of EEG-LFP and/or unitary activity in order to implement proper methods to decode the estimated running distance starting from a dataset of electrophysiology recordings in behaving rats. The final goal will be to quantify the information carried by population and single units activity within the entorhinal circuit.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Link to project repository/sources\r\n\r\nblank\r\n\r\n### Goals for Brainhack Global\r\n\r\n-\tDiscuss about pros and cons of different decoding methods;\r\n-\tSort-out the most appropriate one(s) for our project;\r\n-\tStart implementing the analysis on the dataset;\r\n-\tMore in general, seeding future collaborations.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Good first issues\r\n\r\n-\tHere you\u2019ll find some of our previous studies to have more insight about the neuroscientific framework of the project (https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28161726/, https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30783085/).\r\n\r\n\r\n### Communication channels\r\n\r\nhttps://distanceestim-7gc4659.slack.com/archives/C0484F29VUP\r\n\r\n### Skills\r\n\r\nNeural decoding 100%\r\nEEG/LFP and single units 80%\r\nSpatial cognition 50%\r\n\r\n\r\n### Onboarding documentation\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### What will participants learn?\r\n\r\nThe scientific project has already a solid background in terms of hypothesis, dataset acquisition and analysis.
