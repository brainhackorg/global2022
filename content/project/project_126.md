The goal is to look at the signal from these regions during sucrose and cocaine self administration, to discover the role of these pathways in food vs cocaine intake. In addition, we would focus on discrete behavior during the trails ( lever pressing, reward delivery, error responses) to study the signals of these pathways during both sucrose and cocaine intake. \r\n\r\n- What makes your project special and exciting?\r\n  It will be the first time the hyperdirect pathway is studied in such detail, looking at the mulitpule cortical projection the STN and comparing their roles in food vs cocaine rewards. From perovious work in the lab, we know that STN lesions have opposite effects on cocaine and food intake, increasing food intake while decreasing cocaine intake. This study will explore the much less studies hyperdirect pathway and its role in addiction like behaviors so that the STN can be consided a target for theraputic treatment in addiction, without harming a persons natural motivations for food. \r\n- How to get started?\r\n I have collected data from sucrose taking rats, and addapted an open souce code to fit my data. I next need help on further analysis, combinding results into groups, and doing statistical analysis. \r\n- Where to find key resources?\r\n some codes I have used or wish to try:\r\n https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-021-03626-9\r\nhttps://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31680685/\r\n\r\n### Link to project repository/sources\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/MayaIwilliams/Fiber_processing % my data and modified code\r\nhttps://github.com/LernerLab/GuPPy % GUI developed by a different lab.
