We call it CuttingGardens. It is made of \"Gardens\" that host their own local event, and connect together and with the global community via live sessions. We would like to create a platform similar to https://brainhack.org/global2022/ on which we could:\r\n  1. offer resources for applying Gardens, similar to what Brainhack has [here](https://github.com/brainhackorg/bhg-event-materials).\r\n  2. collect Garden candidates via a submission form similar to what Brainhack has [here for local events](https://github.com/brainhackorg/global2022/issues/new?assignees=&labels=project&template=project-submission-template.yml).\r\n  3. Display the catalog of tutorial, lectures, and other local events in a dynamic way, perhaps in a similar way as what Brainhack has [here for projects](https://brainhack.org/global2022/projects/)\r\n\r\nWe have a team of a handful places across the Americas, Europe, and Asia, willing to be a Garden. We'd like to facilitate more joining and think Brainhack is a great model!\r\n\r\n### What makes our project special and exciting?\r\n\r\nThe website project itself isn't the most exciting part, of course, but CuttingGardens is one we love. [This is why](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1mWphKl6z-oVHWKn0uXcddd9Jt9v3uqk13D9Zex2JiJg/edit?usp=sharing).\r\n\r\n**For you,** participating to this brainhack is a good way to get to know the people behind CuttingEEG, and perhaps link with us to run your own Garden next year! We hope you can also learn how to organize a worldwide community around events like Brainhack and CuttingGardens...\r\n\r\nThere is **a no coding part** (collecting documents, creating forms) and **a coding part** (handle search queries and display results).\r\n\r\n### How to get started?\r\n\r\nWe already forked the relevant repos [here](https://github.com/CuttingGardens). You should do the same if you want to contribute.\r\n\r\nThe next best thing to do is probably to get in touch with @maximilien to find out where your energy is worth spending!\r\n\r\n\r\n### Link to project repository/sources\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/CuttingGardens\r\n\r\n### Goals for Brainhack Global\r\n\r\nWe'd like to get a first draft or the website up and running. With key features (submission, visualization, roadmap for documents etc.) set up.\r\n  1. sort out and/or adapt applicable resources from [here](https://github.com/brainhackorg/bhg-event-materials).\r\n  2. set up a submission form similar to what Brainhack has [here for local events](https://github.com/brainhackorg/global2022/issues/new?assignees=&labels=project&template=project-submission-template.yml)\r\n  3. Find a way to dynamically display search results like [here for projects](https://brainhack.org/global2022/projects/) perhaps even showing this in a calendar, on a world map...\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Good first issues\r\n\r\n### Working on point 1: materials and resources\r\n1. Fork the [git repo](https://github.com/CuttingGardens/bhg-event-materials)\r\n2. On the README.md page, separate materials related to the event organisation (how tos), actual materials (e.g. forms), links to external/extended resources (e.g. learning brain imaging, find out what's a donut...)\r\n3. Organize that page so that it has 1) hitchhiker's guide to Garden organisation (the document Yu-Fang et al. have been working on), 2) materials for organisation (checklists, badges, forms etc.)\r\n\r\n### Working on point 2: forms and Garden submissions\r\n1. Learn about advantages and disadvantages of using a github issue form vs. a google form vs. something else\r\n2. Think of the relevant information to collect for Garden applications and put these in a form\r\n3. Set up that form\r\n\r\n### Working on point 3: search and display gardens and program\r\n1. Figure out how brainhack does it\r\n2. Figure out if this is a good solution for us\r\n3. If yes, then fork it for our own needs\r\n4. If not, then figure out how we want to do it... and do it ?\r\n\r\n### Communication channels\r\n\r\nhttps://mattermost.brainhack.org/brainhack/channels/cuttingeeg-gardens-general\r\n\r\n### Skills\r\n\r\n**None needed, but below skills are helpful.**\r\n\r\n### Working on point 1:\r\n- Some familiarity with github (how to edit a readme.md file)\r\n- Editing in English\r\n- Experience with organizing events (knowing priorities and must do, must have for a conference venue)\r\n\r\n### Working on point 2:\r\n- Creating a form in Ggle or Github\r\n- Experience with organizing events (knowing priorities and must do, must have for a conference venue)\r\n\r\n### Working on point 3:\r\nParticularly appreciated is help with figuring out how to interrogate a table and display results.\r\nAny of the skills below are more than welcome.\r\n- [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com) website programming\r\n- [Hugo](https://gohugo.io) website programming\r\n- Adding an open streetmap with custom locations to a webpage. Showing icons (badges shown [here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1mWphKl6z-oVHWKn0uXcddd9Jt9v3uqk13D9Zex2JiJg/edit#slide=id.g13db6544451_0_1)) on that map...\r\n- Displaying search results in a calendar, in a table...\r\n\r\n### Onboarding documentation\r\n\r\nWhat is [CuttingGardens](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1mWphKl6z-oVHWKn0uXcddd9Jt9v3uqk13D9Zex2JiJg/edit#slide=id.p)\r\n\r\nGet in touch! ping @maximilien.chaumon on mattermost!\r\n\r\n### What will participants learn?\r\n\r\nOkay, it's mostly soft skills:\r\n- Community\r\n- collaborative documentation\r\n- Git/GitHub \r\n- Jekll (https://jekyllrb.com/)\r\n- Hugo (https://gohugo.io/)\r\n\r\n### Data to use\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### Number of collaborators\r\n\r\n3\r\n\r\n### Credit to collaborators\r\n\r\nYou'll be credited on the webpage.\r\n\r\n### Image\r\n\r\nLeave this text if you don't have an image yet.\r\n\r\n### Type\r\n\r\ndocumentation, visualization, other\r\n\r\n### Development status\r\n\r\n1_basic structure\r\n\r\n### Topic\r\n\r\ndata_visualisation, diversity_inclusivity_equality, other\r\n\r\n### Tools\r\n\r\nother\r\n\r\n### Programming language\r\n\r\nhtml_css, javascript, not_applicable\r\n\r\n### Modalities\r\n\r\nnot_applicable\r\n\r\n### Git skills\r\n\r\n0_no_git_skills, 1_commit_push, 2_branches_PRs\r\n\r\n### Anything else?\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### Things to do after the project is submitted and ready to review.\r\n\r\n- [x] Add a comment below the main post of your issue saying: `Hi @brainhackorg/project-monitors my project is ready!`\r\n- [x] Twitter-sized summary of your project pitch.\r\n\r\nMy twitter-sized pitch:\r\n@CuttingEEG is taking part in Brainhack Global with a project \"Hacking brainhack.org!\". Join us if you want to learn more about the inner workings of an event organization such as Brainhack Global or CuttingGardens, the new event that CuttingEEG is preparing... In the real world, we'll sit in brainhack Donostia. Online, everywhere!",
