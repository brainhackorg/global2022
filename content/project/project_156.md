For example, some studies share this information in `.tsv`, `.csv`, and some even share this information in `.pdf` files. Building upon the recent [guidelines for phenotypic data in BIDS](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1WTkfES8L0vItZVyyR68fc-9cO03jS-kCnMnw6602pbc/edit#heading=h.4k1noo90gelw), we created a repository to share the phenotypes in a uniform & machine-readable format for a few commonly used neuroimaging datasets.\r\nWe have written the code to extract a dictionary.json (a file that contains a list of the phenotypes present and their description) for a few datasets, but this can be extended to other neuroimaging datasets. A list of other possible contributions is present on the [github issues](https://github.com/ericearl/dataset-phenotypes/issues).\n\n### Link to project repository/sources\n\n- [Project repository](https://github.com/ericearl/dataset-phenotypes)\r\n- [The Phenotypic Data Guidelines for the BIDS extension](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1WTkfES8L0vItZVyyR68fc-9cO03jS-kCnMnw6602pbc/edit#heading=h.gjdgxs)\r\n- This [link](https://osf.io/35sxv/) contains the OHBM 2022 poster that summarizes the Phenotypic Data Guidelines for the BIDS extension\n\n### Goals for Brainhack Global\n\n- Extract HBN data dictionary\r\n- Add other datasets according to the contributor's interest\r\n- Conceptualize and provide a GUI to select phenotype of interests from the dictionary.json\r\n\n\n### Good first issues\n\n1. issue one: Run the code for one of the provided datasets. See if there are any issues/bugs and if necessary improve their documentation\r\n2. To see more issues check our [github issues](https://github.com/ericearl/dataset-phenotypes/issues).\n\n### Communication channels\n\nbids-phenotype channel on brainhack DC's slack workspace\n\n### Skills\n\n- Python: basic to intermediate \r\n- Git: basic to intermediate to make changes to the current code\r\n- User experience of how it is to run the code\n\n### Onboarding documentation\n\n_No response_\n\n### What will participants learn?\n\n- Reading and manipulating pandas dataframes\r\n- Creating a GUI using Python\r\n- Getting familiar and collaborating with Git\r\n- Documenting code\n\n### Data to use\n\n_No response_\n\n### Number of collaborators\n\nmore\n\n### Credit to collaborators\n\nAll collaborators will be added to the git repository and will be on the abstract submission of this project to the [OHBM conference](https://www.humanbrainmapping.org/i4a/pages/index.cfm?pageid=4114)\n\n### Image\n\nLeave this text if you don't have an image yet.\n\n### Type\n\ndata_management\n\n### Development status\n\n0_concept_no_content\n\n### Topic\n\nother\n\n### Tools\n\nBIDS\n\n### Programming language\n\nPython\n\n### Modalities\n\nother\n\n### Git skills\n\n0_no_git_skills, 1_commit_push, 2_branches_PRs\n\n### Anything else?\n\n_No response_\n\n### Things to do after the project is submitted and ready to review.\n\n- [x] Add a comment below the main post of your issue saying: `Hi @brainhackorg/project-monitors my project is ready!`\n- [ ] Twitter-sized summary of your project pitch.",
