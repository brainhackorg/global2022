Yet, there are not many options of such stimulation device compared to other successful electrical stimulators such as neuromuscular electrical stimulator (NMES) and functional electrical stimulator (FES), especially for most people around the world. \r\n\r\nThe objective of this project is to design a simple, easy-to-build transcutaneous electrical stimulator (OpenXstim) to facilitate anyone with the modest technological knowledge to develop their own stimulator for the spinal cord stimulation treatment.\n\n### Link to project repository/sources\n\nhttps://github.com/OpenXstim/OpenVstim\n\n### Goals for Brainhack Global\n\nThe goal is the collect different ideas and inputs during the Brainhack event to further furnish the design of OpenXstim\n\n### Good first issues\n\n1. issue one: Designing an optimum constant current tropology for 10kHz biphasic stimulation. \r\n\r\n2. issue two: Improving the safety features to avoid unsupervised stimulation. \r\n\n\n### Communication channels\n\nhttps://join.slack.com/share/enQtNDI0MjIyNzc1Mzk3MC1mMGU1NGY0MzIyMDE1YTg2ZWU2MjkzN2I0N2RlNmY4M2JlNzgyNTFmZTRjMWVlZDA2OTkzOWVkODlmYzY2OTVi\n\n### Skills\n\n- Power Electronics: Advanced\r\n- Analogue and Digital Electronics: Advanced\r\n- C/C++: Intermediate\n\n### Onboarding documentation\n\n_No response_\n\n### What will participants learn?\n\n- Electrophysiology (Neuromodulation)\r\n- Rehabilitation Engineering\r\n- Bioelectronic Medicine\n\n### Data to use\n\n_No response_\n\n### Number of collaborators\n\n1\n\n### Credit to collaborators\n\nAcknowledgements to the published work. \n\n### Image\n\nLeave this text if you don't have an image yet.\r\n![Wallpaper](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/109132792/196593681-4f6cc15a-1c59-4255-aee6-305fd1c8faf0.jpeg)\r\n\n\n### Type\n\nmethod_development\n\n### Development status\n\n2_releases_existing\n\n### Topic\n\nphysiology, systems_neuroscience, other\n\n### Tools\n\nother\n\n### Programming language\n\nC++\n\n### Modalities\n\nother\n\n### Git skills\n\n4_not_applicable\n\n### Anything else?\n\n_No response_\n\n### Things to do after the project is submitted and ready to review.\n\n- [ ] Add a comment below the main post of your issue saying: `Hi @brainhackorg/project-monitors my project is ready!`\n- [ ] Twitter-sized summary of your project pitch.",
