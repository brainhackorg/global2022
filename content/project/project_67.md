  "content": "## Project title:\nNeuroCausal: a FAIRer neuropsychology\n\n## Project leader:\nValentina Borghesani\n\n## Email:\nvalentinaborghesani@gmail.com\n\n## Collaborators:\nIsil Poyraz Bilgin, Sladjana Lukic, Pedro Pinheiro-Chagas\n\n## Brainhack Global 2022 Event:\nBrainHack Donostia\n\n## Topic:\nCausality, Data visualization, Machine learning, Reproducible scientific methods, Neuropsychology, Natural Language Processing (NLP)\n\n## What is the purpose of the project:\nWe are working with clinicians, neuroimagers, and software developers to develop an open source platform for the storage, sharing, synthesis and meta-analysis of human clinical data to the service of the clinical and cognitive neuroscience community so that the future of neuropsychology can be transdiagnostic, open, and FAIR.Following the steps of what enable a similar transition in functional neuroimaging, we are breaking down our over-ambitious goal in two stages: (1) create a meta-analytical platform covering lesion-related data hence allowing causal inferences; (2) a data-sharing platform tailored to clinical needs.\n\n## Where can participants find key resources to work on this project:\nFind out more on our website: https://neurocausal.github.io/\n\n## What stage is the project on:\n2\n\n## Required programming skills for the project:\nTasks for all levels\n\n## Background knowledge needed  on the topic:\nBasic\n\n## Data to use:\n\n\n## Link to project repository:\nhttps://github.com/neurocausal\n\n## Goals for Brainhack Donostia 2022:\nWe are hoping to: (1) make progress in adapting the code base of Neuroquery (https://neuroquery.org/) to our question; (2) improve the data source (and possibly structure) of CogAtlas (https://www.cognitiveatlas.org/); (3) make steps forward on the data sharing side. Specific issues will be open on github. \n\n## What will participants learn:\nThanks to the extremely interdisciplinary nature of the project, it can be the ideal occasion to get your feet wet with natural language processing (e.g., extract key info from texts), or neuropsychology (e.g., established link between task performance and disorders), or data sharing issues (both ethical and practical). Or all of the above!\n\n## Number of collaborators:\n3\n\n## Credit to collaborators:\nAny contributor will be listed on our github page and website. This is an ongoing, long term project: we meet weekly and communicate via mattermost. Any contributor would be invitate to become part of this core group of volunteers.\n\n## Type of project:\nData management, Documentation, Pipeline development, Visualization\n\n## Programming languages:\nPython\n\n## Necessary git skills level for the project:\nBasic (commit & push)\n\n## Modality:\nBehavioral, MRI\n\n## Software suites:\n"
